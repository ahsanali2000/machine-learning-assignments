# Machine Learning Assignments
This repository is created to public my group machine learning assignments for the course of Machine Learning at University of Goettingen.

## First Assignment
This assignment is regarding the custom implementation of linear regression and comparing it with scikitlearn implementation. Next step is to do regularization with ridge regression.
## Second Assignment
This assignment is introduction to pyTorch and we implement the same problem in this assignment as we did in first assignment.
