# Machine Learning Assignments
This repository is created to public my group machine learning assignments for the course of Machine Learning to help students get familiar with machine learning course offered in 2023 at University of Goettingen.

## First Assignment
This assignment is regarding the custom implementation of linear regression and comparing it with scikitlearn implementation. Next step is to do regularization with ridge regression.
## Second Assignment
This assignment is introduction to pyTorch and we implement the same problem in this assignment as we did in first assignment.
## Third Assignment
In this assignment you will implement multiclass classification with classic Logistic Regression, Multilayer Preceptron, and the convolutional neural network LeNet5 on image data.
## Fourth Assignment
In this assignment you are going to use a tabular dataset. We will test two different approaches - forests and neural networks and compare performance. You are also going to learn how to make trees interpretable.
